# SPINNE
an app for human vertebral height estimation based on artificial neural networks

# About
SPINNE is decision support system built with R and [Shiny web framework](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) to provide vertebral
height estimation - reconstruction which has several important applications in biological anthropology and forensic medicine.

SPINNE implements a single- and multi-output regression approach to missing value estimation through the training of a modified
[Generalized Regression Neural Network](https://github.com/dsnavega/grnnet) architecture.

SPINNE is available on-line as part of the [Osteomics](http://osteomics.com/) project and can be accessed at
[http://osteomics.com/SPINNE](http://osteomics.com/SPINNE).

SPINNE was developed and is maintained by [Jo√£o Coelho](https://scholar.google.pt/citations?user=Yeb6Q3gAAAAJ&hl) and
